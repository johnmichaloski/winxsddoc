sfxsdcomments.vbs 
=================

This is windows vb script to generate html documentation from XSD files.

The vb script runs a xslt filters on all XML schemas (XSD) in a folder to generate documentation.

The vb script xslt filters are from xs3p. The latest documentation for xs3p is maintained on the FiForms
documentation wiki at:  http://wiki.fiforms.org/index.php/Xs3p

In order to use xs3p, you need an XSLT processor, of which msxsl.exe was used.



Installation
=============
Download msxsl.exe from here:  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21714
xs3p download: http://www.fiforms.org/download/


Usage
======
For each xsd file, it creates a corresponding html file containing extracted documentation.
The vb script also recursively descends into subfolders to find XSD files.
Finally, the vb script generates an index file

1) click on the sfxsdcomments.vbs script
2) A vbs folder browser dialog will pop up asking for the top folder you want to recusively scan to find and document
xsd files.
3) It will recursively scan folders and process each xsd file to generate a html file containing the documentation.
4) Wait while console screens pop up and then disappear as each xsd file is processed. NOTE THIS CAN TAKE A WHILE
FOR WELL-DOCUMENTED AND LARGE XSD FILES.
5) An index.html file is generated in the to level folder that you started the recusive scan in.



Improvements
============
Provide shadow folder dialog for documentation. Currently, its embedded in the xsd folder.
